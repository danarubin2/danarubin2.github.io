                                            Over the summer of 2021, I worked virtually on Roku's New Products Team, which is based in Austin, Texas! I was responsible
                                            for checking manual test cases as well as creating automated ones. Beyond creating and verifying test cases, I also looked
                                            at the logs for tests that had failed in order to determine their cause of failure and report and bugs that were found. 
                                            By the end of the summer, I had gained experience throughout different areas of QA testing and also worked with one other intern
                                            to create test cases that would test new Roku TV functionality. This job required knowledge of Python and tools like Docker, 
                                            Perforce, bug management tools, and the command line.

                                            Next summer, I will be returning to work with Roku full time as a QA Engineer!

                                            In a partially remote and partially in-person internship, I spent six weeks working with Spectrum's 
                                            Automation Development team in Charlotte, North Carolina. I first received training in the team's central
                                            automation framework before embarking on my own journey of creating test cases for
                                            projects based in web services, web applications, database applications, and desktop applications. I
                                            primarily used tools such as SoapUI, Selenium, and Winium to develop test cases and I used Jenkins to run
                                            them.

                                            As a learning assistant in COMP 210: Data Structures, I help teach programming concepts to other 
                                            students while also fortifying my own knowledge in the process. I hold office hours sessions to help students with 
                                            programming assignments and also hold weekly review sessions to help smaller groups
                                            of students understand lecture content. In this role, I regularly program and debug in Java, create and debug 
                                            JUnit tests, and work with IDE's such as IntelliJ and Eclipse. In previous semesters, I helped with 
                                            COMP 401: Foundations of Programming, a class focused on teaching object-oriented programming and design patterns. 
                                            In total, I have served three semesters as a learning assistant and plan on continuing!

                                            In my first summer experiences, I served as a first grade counselor at Camp Mindy. Each year, I worked with two other 
                                            co-counselors and was responsible for making sure that campers stayed safe and had fun. This required me to ensure that
                                            campers arrived at activities on time and were following directions. I was also responsible for resolving any conflicts
                                            between campers (which, when working with first graders, proved to be difficult at times)! This job strengthened my
                                            communication skills with people of all ages, as it required me to work together with co-counselors, children, and parents
                                            alike. Although I have moved on from my summer camp days, I look back fondly at my time as a counselor!

                                            As the education chair of UNC's first Web Development club, I seek to teach basic web development skills to students
                                            coming into the club with varying degrees of experience. With the help of the other officers on my team, I have led the creation
                                            of an eight week curriculum focused on teaching students how to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create websites while also providing them
                                            with opportunities and activities to practice these skills. The end goal of this curriculum is that by the end of the eight weeks, all
                                            participating students will be prepared to work on projects for local
                                            businesses and organizations regardless of their initial knowledge of web development.
