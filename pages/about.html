                      <p class="lead about-text">
                          While I was born and raised in North Carolina, the entire rest of my family was born in New York
                          and often jokes about how I am the only "true Southerner" in our family. I think this is an acceptable
                          claim for my sometimes stereotypical New Yorker parents to say, but I am not sure how accurate it is for
                          my two older brothers who, like me, spent their childhood, adolescence, and college years in North Carolina.
                          But, despite their sometimes nonsensical jokes, I believe that having brothers shaped me into the persistent
                          individual I am today. In fact, it was my oldest brother Matthew who first suggested that I take a Computer
                          Science course in high school, almost nagging me by repeatedly telling me that I "might enjoy it". So, I
                          suppose that if my majoring in Computer Science and creation of this website is evidence of nothing else, it 
                          at least shows that sometimes your siblings are right.

                            I have loved puzzles for as long as I can remember. In fact, I still 
                            have a note from one of my preschool teachers proclaiming that I am the
                            "puzzle queen". While I don't remember how many puzzles I could have possibly
                            completed when I was four years old in order to earn that distinction, I do
                            remember growing up solving puzzles on the floor in front of my front door, scrambling
                            to finish as many as I could before my mom would tell me to clean it up before the house got too 
                            messy. And, while I have since upgraded to a real table for all of my puzzle 
                            solving, I still have the same passion for all types of puzzles that I had when I was a 
                            child. Whether I am solving a classic jigsaw puzzle or trying to get faster at solving my
                            Rubik's cube (my record is eight seconds!), I thoroughly enjoy the process of being able to 
                            relax and slowly piece together a solution to some larger picture.

                              I wouldn't be able to make a website sharing fun facts about myself without mentioning Survivor.
                              Even the show might be older than me (only by two months!), I have watched almost every season
                              and consider myself to be a huge fan of the show. Between the phsyical feats, strategy, and of
                              course, the drama, I haven't been able to stop watching Survivor since I first discovered it
                              five years ago. In this photo, my friend and I are pictured with Alison Raybould, a doctor
                              at UNC Chapel Hill and a Survivor contestant who hosted a watch party that I attended when her season
                              aired in 2018. While I am not sure that I would ever go on the show myself, I can be sure that
                              I will be watching every episode I can! In addition to Survivor, some of my other favorite shows that
                              I deem equally binge-worthy include Brooklyn 99, The Good Place, and Black Mirror.
